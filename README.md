# Bucket Homepage Demo

To help new users understand the Bucket product, I iterated on our homepage design using various media to illustrate Bucket's text-to-visual tools. In the end, this one-click demo had the best conversion.

My code was used in the production site. Please note that this code used to be integrated into a Rails app and has been heavily refactored to become standalone.
